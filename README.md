# Trava URL Shortener

## Problem
Long URLs are generated by the app to represent the filter and sort state on the users table. While functional, these URLs can be unwieldy and difficult to share.

## Solution
This service creates short identifiers that map to filter/sort states. When a user shares a short URL, it references the stored state, providing a clean and simple experience.

## API Endpoints

### `POST /shorten`
- Request Body: JSON representing filter/sort state
- Response: Short URL with unique identifier

### `GET /expand/{id}`
- Path Parameter: ID returned by `/shorten`
- Response: Original filter/sort state JSON

## How to Run Locally
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd trava-url-shortener
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Next Steps
- Replace in-memory store with Redis/PostgreSQL
- Add authentication/authorization for security
- Implement TTL for stored states
- Add compression/encryption for privacy
- Add automated tests and monitoring
